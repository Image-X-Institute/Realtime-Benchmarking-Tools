## Tools for benchmarking real-time radiotherapy systems  

Included in this data are lung [1] and prostate [2] patient measured motion traces, CT and contour sets (defined as per RTOG 1021 and RTOG 0938 respectively).  
  
This data collection consists of images acquired during chemoradiotherapy of 20 locally-advanced, non-small cell lung cancer patients. Members of the Image X Institute have contributed to the data collection and used this data for R&D purposes.
